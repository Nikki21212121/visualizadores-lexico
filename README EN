
# Animated and Comparative Visualizers of Lexical Frequency

This project provides two independent Dash + Plotly apps designed to visualize the lexical evolution of words and categories over time. Both tools are based on a microdiachronic corpus of 20th and 21st century Spanish language.

## üìå Tools Included

1. **Bubble Chart Visualizer**
   - Animated evolution of words or categories.
   - Bubble size corresponds to lexical frequency.
   - Interactive filters for normalization type, word/category selection, and moving average.

2. **Line Chart Visualizer**
   - Static and detailed evolution of word or category frequencies over time.
   - Includes year-range slider and automatic top-N selection.
   - Offers various normalizations and optional rolling average.
